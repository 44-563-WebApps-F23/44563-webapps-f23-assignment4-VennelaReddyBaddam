        <h3>An Enemy of the People Act 3-Henrik Ibsen</h3>
        
        <pre>
            <h3 class="Billing">Billing</h3> <p class="Speech">Well, I must say!</p>
            
            <h3 class="Hovstad">Hovstad</h3> <p class="Speech">Have you read it through?</p> 
            <h3 class="Billing">Billing</h3><p class="Speech">Yes, indeed I have.</p> 
            
            <h3 class="Hovstad">Hovstad</h3><p class="Speech">Don't you think the Doctor hits them pretty hard?
            </p> 
            <h3 class="Billing">Billing</h3> <p class="Speech">Hard? Bless my soul, he's crushing! Every word falls like—how shall I put it?—like the blow of a sledgehammer.</p>
            
            <h3 class="Hovstad">Hovstad</h3> <p class="Speech">Yes, but they are not the people to throw up the sponge at the
                first blow.</p> 
            
            <h3 class="Billing">Billing</h3> <p class="Speech">That is true; and for that reason we must strike blow upon
                blow until the whole of this aristocracy tumbles to pieces. As I sat in
                there reading this, I almost seemed to see a revolution in being.</p>
            
            <h3 class="Hovstad">Hovstad</h3> <p class="Speech">Hush!—Speak so that Aslaksen cannot hear you.</p>
            
            <h3 class="Billing">Billing</h3> <p class="Speech">Aslaksen is a chicken-hearted chap, a
                coward; there is nothing of the man in him. But this time you will
                insist on your own way, won't you? You will put the Doctor's article in?</p>
            
            <h3 class="Hovstad">Hovstad</h3> <p class="Speech">Yes, and if the Mayor doesn't like it—</p>
            
            <h3 class="Billing">Billing</h3> <p class="Speech">That will be the devil of a nuisance.</p>
            
            <h3 class="Hovstad">Hovstad</h3><p class="Speech">Well, fortunately we can turn the situation to good account,
                whatever happens. If the Mayor will not fall in with the Doctor's
                project, he will have all the small tradesmen down on him—the whole of
                the Householders' Association and the rest of them. And if he does fall
                in with it, he will fall out with the whole crowd of large shareholders
                in the Baths, who up to now have been his most valuable supporters—
                </p> 
            <h3 class="Billing">Billing</h3> <p class="Speech">Yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty
                penny—</p> 
            
            <h3 class="Hovstad">Hovstad</h3> <p class="Speech">Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
                be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
                enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
                another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
                the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
                the Liberals.</p>
