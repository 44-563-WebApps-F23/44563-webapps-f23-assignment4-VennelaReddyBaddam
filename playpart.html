        <h1>Vennela Reddy Baddam- Acts in play</h1>

            Billing. Well, I must say!
            
            Hovstad (still writing). Have you read it through?
            
            Billing (laying the MS. on the desk). Yes, indeed I have.
            
            Hovstad. Don't you think the Doctor hits them pretty hard?
            
            Billing. Hard? Bless my soul, he's crushing! Every word falls like—how
            shall I put it?—like the blow of a sledgehammer.
            
            Hovstad. Yes, but they are not the people to throw up the sponge at the
            first blow.
            
            Billing. That is true; and for that reason we must strike blow upon
            blow until the whole of this aristocracy tumbles to pieces. As I sat in
            there reading this, I almost seemed to see a revolution in being.
            
            Hovstad (turning round). Hush!—Speak so that Aslaksen cannot hear you.
            
            Billing (lowering his voice). Aslaksen is a chicken-hearted chap, a
            coward; there is nothing of the man in him. But this time you will
            insist on your own way, won't you? You will put the Doctor's article in?
            
            Hovstad. Yes, and if the Mayor doesn't like it—
            
            Billing. That will be the devil of a nuisance.
            
            Hovstad. Well, fortunately we can turn the situation to good account,
            whatever happens. If the Mayor will not fall in with the Doctor's
            project, he will have all the small tradesmen down on him—the whole of
            the Householders' Association and the rest of them. And if he does fall
            in with it, he will fall out with the whole crowd of large shareholders
            in the Baths, who up to now have been his most valuable supporters—
            
            Billing. Yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty
            penny—
            
            Hovstad. Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
            be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
            enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
            another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
            the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
            the Liberals.</pre>
